This repo contains the slides, exercises and example solutions for the Java programming course, hold by Julius and Benny (WS19/20).

Rendered format can be found on [github.io](https://pibebtol.github.io/java-lessons/).

The content (slides and exercises) is basically a fork of [the content in the fsr repo](https://github.com/fsr/java-lessons/) with some adjustments.
The solutions are only examples of how to solve the tasks, this can always be done in different ways.
