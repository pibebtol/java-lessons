### Description
In a small library you can lend books for reading.
Every book has a title and a ISBN number.
The library can have the same book multiple times.
In the library is space for up to ten books.

### Task
1. Modell the classes `Library` and `Book`.
2. Build a constructor for the class `Book` that accepts a title and a ISBN number.
3. Build functions in the class `Book` that return the title and ISBN number.
4. Implement a `main` method in the class `Library`, that creates multiple books and tests the functions of the class `Book`.

### Hints
* A ISBN has 13 digits. Use either *long* (as *int* is to short) or *String*.
* For the assignment of `long` values a `L` attached to the value:
```
long var = 1234501234567890L
```
