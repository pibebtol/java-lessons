## Geometric Shapes

### Description
There are different geometric shapes.
All geometric shapes have a perimeter and an area.
Some geometric shapes need the constant pi to calculate these values.

### Tasks
1. Implement an abstract class `GeometricShape` that defines the functions to get the perimeter and the area and a static for pi.
2. Implement the classes `Square`, `Circle` and `Rectangle` that `extends` the Interface `GeometricShape`.
3. Implement constructors that contain the parameters needed to calculate the functions (like radius, length of sides...).
4. Implement the functions for the different shapes.
5. Write a "Main"-class `ShapeTester` that tests your implementation
