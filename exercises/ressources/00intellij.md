## Setup Guide for Intellij

* Download and install java (for windows see [here](https://pibebtol.github.io/java-lessons/exercises/ressources/00windows.html), for linux, check out your wiki of choice or ask us)
* Download and install [intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).
* if you get the welcome screen, click *Create new project* **or** go to *File > New > Project*
* choose java from the left, don't check anything in the first view, just click on next
* enter the project name and *finish*
* open the project, click the `src` folder, press Alt+Insert or rightclick it and navigate to *New > Class* and create a new java class
* enter the name (Upper Case!)
* create a main method (you can just type `main` within the class brackets and choose the autosuggestion option)
* run your class by
  * **opening the class and clicking on the *green arrow icon* left of the code**
  * **choose run in the the upper context menu**
  * (probably more options like shortcuts, I do not have it installed for testing right now)
