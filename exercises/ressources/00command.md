## Using the command line to run your code

* Download and install java (for windows see [here](https://pibebtol.github.io/java-lessons/exercises/ressources/00windows.html), for linux, check out your wiki of choice or ask us)
* open a terminal and use the `cd` command to get into the directory, where your code is
  * `cd` stands for change directory
  * you have to tell it the next directory to enter, or the whole path
  * example `cd Program\ Files/java/bin` (this is not, where you should place your code, just an example. maybe put your code into *Users/$username/Workspace* or something)
  * *extra hint:* you can type `cd U` and then press Tabulator twice and it tries to fill the next fitting directory names
* the next steps assume you have created the file *HelloWorld.java* and wrote the code as in the example
* type `javac HelloWorld.java` and press enter
  * this *compiles* your code > translates it from java into something, that the computer is able to understand, called a binary
  * if you get some output on that, you have made a mistake > check what it says and try to figure out, what you made wrong
  * if you can't ask the internet or us
* type `java HelloWorld` to execute your code
  * this runs your little program and should print **Hello World!** to the console
