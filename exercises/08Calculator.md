## Calculator

### Tasks
1. Modell the class `Calculator` with a `main` method.
2. Ask the user for input of two numbers (`int`). (see hint)
3. Ask the user for the operand (+,-,* or /)(`String`).
4. Calculate and print out the solution.

#### Additional Tasks
1. Implement a solution for the problem ”division by zero”.
2. Use a loop for the input to calculate as much as you want.

### Hints
* Hints for user input: http://alvinalexander.com/java/edu/pj/pj010005
* For simplicity you can assume that the user only inputs correct values.
