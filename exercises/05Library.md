## Library extended

### Description

The library lends different media, books and dvds. Every media has a title, ISBN and a publishing company. Additionally every book has an author and the number of pages and a DVD has a duration and main actors (string of their names).

The library can hold multiple copies of the same book or dvd.

The library has 1 shelf with at most 20 media items.

### Tasks
